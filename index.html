<h4>My Review of Another Snowboarding Site<h4> <a href = "http://www.snowboarder.com/">Snowboard.com<a></div>
<p>
This site is obviously a lot more comprehensive then my basic site. Upon inspection of its elements, there are concepts such as making things visible or not based on whether the mouse is over (visibility:hitten). The site clearly breaks things up using divs. They also have much more complex things like introducing javascript into the page language = "javascript". They also use a lot of class elements, which I am guessing indicate the style in which that content gets displayed. They also seem to have !important style tags on some of their stuff. It is a truly beautiful website, and whats best about it is the fact that is flows so smoothly from page to page, and image aspect ratios are correct, and super high pixel, giving it's viewers a real draw to stay on the site and look through pictures and videos. But all in all, I do love the site!
